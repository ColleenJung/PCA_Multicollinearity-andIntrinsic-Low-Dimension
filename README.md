#PCA #Multicollinearity #Intrinsic Low Dimension

### Intrinisic dimension
- Intrinsic dimension is the number of PCA features needed to approximate a dataset.
- If we need to reduce the dimension we should know which features we should select and which to neglect.
- Usually, PCA in Sklearn will automatically find the number of Intrinsic Dimensions itself.
- It will consider PCA features with significant variance.

### How?
- Discards low variance PCA features
- Assumes the high variance features are informative

### PCA Model
- The goal of PCA is to identify patterns in a data set, and then distill the variables down to their most important features so that the data is simplified without losing important traits.
